# 🎙️ Accent Classification using Wav2Vec2

A Deep Learning project that uses HuggingFace's Wav2Vec2 model to classify English audio accents as **Canadian** 🇨🇦 or **British (England)** 🏴. Built with PyTorch, Transformers, and Librosa, this project achieves high accuracy on voice-based accent prediction.

---

## ✅ Results

- **Accuracy**: 97.83%
- **Precision**: 100.00%
- **Recall**: 95.35%
- **F1 Score**: 97.62%

### 🖥️ Gradio Web App

A sleek, dark-themed **Gradio interface** has been added to make accent classification interactive and user-friendly!

* 🎤 Supports both **microphone recording** and **file upload**.
* 🧠 Uses the fine-tuned `Wav2Vec2` model for detecting **Canadian** or **British** English accents.
* 🌌 Clean dark mode layout with **colorful buttons** for a smooth user experience.
* ✅ Built with `gradio==5.38.2`.

> 🚀 Simply run `app.py` to launch the app locally:
>
> ```bash
> python app.py

## 🧰 Setup Instructions

> Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git installed ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/creativepurus/Accent_Classification.git
cd Accent_Classification
```

### 3️⃣ Create & Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create venv (do this only once)
python -m venv venv

# Activate venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open `en_model.ipynb` and run the cells step-by-step.

---

## 📊 Outputs

- `model_predictions.csv` → Stores predictions with confidence
- Graphs folder → Contains plots like confusion matrix, class-wise distribution
- Trained model saved to `wav2vec2-accent-classifier/`
