# Code Explanation

## Importing Libraries and Modules 📚🔧
- Imports essential libraries and modules for subsequent machine learning tasks.
- Includes tools for data manipulation (`os`, `pandas`), audio processing (`torchaudio`), model training (`torch`, `transformers`), and visualization (`tqdm`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`).
- Imports the `Wav2Vec2` model from Hugging Face's Transformers library.

## Data Preprocessing 🎛️🔍
- Loads a TSV file containing information about audio files.
- Defines a function to load audio files using the `torchaudio` library.
- Example usage loads an audio file for demonstration.

## Balance the Dataset ⚖️
- Balances the dataset by selecting specific accents and resampling the data.
- Class distribution of the balanced dataset is printed.

## Data Exploration 📊🔍
- Explores the dataset by understanding the distribution of classes and listening to audio samples.
- Provides insights into the distribution of accents and allows for a qualitative understanding of the dataset.

## Split the Data 🔄
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Drops rows with missing values.

## Model Selection Code 🤖🔍
- Loads a pre-trained `Wav2Vec2` model and configures it for the classification task.
- Sets the number of output classes based on the selected accents.

## Checking Data Shapes and Imbalance 📊🧐
- Examines various data-related aspects, including dataset head, shape, and the presence of missing values.
- Checks the distribution of the "locale" column for insights into potential dataset imbalances.

## Data Visualization - Distribution Plot 📊🔍
- Creates a distribution plot using `seaborn` to visualize the distribution of the "locale" column in the balanced dataset.

## Data Visualization - Distribution Plot (for validated_df) 📊🔍
- Creates a distribution plot, this time for the original, unbalanced dataset (`validated_df`).
- Allows for a comparison of language distribution before and after balancing.

## Print All Columns in a Table Format 📊💻
- Prints all columns in a table format for the filtered dataset.
- Provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset's structure and content.

## Definition of CustomAudioDataset 🎛️🎶
- Defines a custom dataset class (`CustomAudioDataset`) to handle audio data.
- Uses the `LabelEncoder` to convert string labels to numerical values, facilitating model training.

## Create Training Dataset 🎛️🔍
- Creates a training dataset (`train_dataset`) using the defined `CustomAudioDataset` class and the loaded processor.

## Create a DataLoader with a Custom Collate Function 🎛️🔍
- Creates a DataLoader for the training dataset using a custom collate function.
- The function pads input tensors to the same size and stacks labels, preparing the data for model training.

## Split the Data Again 🔄
- Splits the data again into training and testing sets without stratification.
- Resulting sets are stored in `train_df` and `test_df`.

## Create the Test Dataset 🎛️🔍
- Creates a test dataset (`test_dataset`) from the testing dataframe (`test_df`).

## Create DataLoader for the Test Set 🎛️🔍
- Creates a DataLoader for the test dataset using the same custom collate function.

## Fine-tuning Setup 🤖⚙️
- Configures training arguments for fine-tuning.
- Specifies the output directory, batch size, number of epochs, and saving options.

## Create Trainer 🤖🎓
- Creates a `Trainer` instance, incorporating the `Wav2Vec2` model, training arguments, and the training dataset.
- Sets the stage for model fine-tuning.

## Training Loop with Metric Calculation 🔄🎓📊
- Initiates the training loop, iterating through epochs and batches.
- Calculates training metrics, including accuracy, precision, and F1 score.

## Final Training Step 🤖🎓
- Executes the final training step, completing the fine-tuning of the `Wav2Vec2` model.

## Evaluate Model on the Test Set 🤖🔍🎓
- Evaluates the trained model on the test set.
- Collects predictions for further metric calculation and analysis.

## Calculate Metrics for the Test Set 📊🎓🔍
- Calculates metrics, including accuracy, precision, and F1 score based on the model's performance on the test set.

## Plot Confusion Matrix for the Test Set 📊🔍
- Generates a confusion matrix using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.
- Visually represents the model's classification performance on the test set.
